## DevOps Engineer Skill Expansion Plan: Daily Tasks (Week 1)

This plan focuses on expanding skills using Kubernetes.  Adjust the tools and concepts to match your chosen learning path.


**Day 1:**

* **Documentation:** Read the Kubernetes documentation on Deployments (specifically, the section on rolling updates and rollbacks).  Focus on understanding the different strategies and their implications.  Take notes on key concepts and terminology.
* **Hands-on:** Create a simple Dockerfile for a Nginx web server and build the image.  Then, create a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file to deploy three replicas of this Nginx container to a local minikube or kind cluster.
* **Cloud-Native Exploration:** Research Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). Understand how it works, its configuration options, and when it's beneficial to use it.
* **Conceptual Question:** What are the advantages and disadvantages of using StatefulSets versus Deployments in Kubernetes?


**Day 2:**

* **Documentation:** Explore the Kubernetes documentation on Services. Focus on understanding different Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, Ingress) and their use cases.
* **Hands-on:** Create a Kubernetes Service of type LoadBalancer (if your environment supports it) or NodePort to expose the Nginx Deployment you created yesterday. Test accessing the Nginx server from outside the cluster.
* **Cloud-Native Exploration:** Investigate Kubernetes Ingress controllers and their role in managing external access to applications. Explore popular Ingress controllers like Nginx Ingress or Traefik.
* **Conceptual Question:** How does Kubernetes handle pod failures and ensure high availability?


**Day 3:**

* **Documentation:** Read the Kubernetes documentation on ConfigMaps and Secrets. Understand how they are used to manage configuration data and sensitive information.
* **Hands-on:** Create a ConfigMap containing Nginx configuration settings and mount it as a volume to your Nginx Deployment. Update the Nginx configuration to use values from the ConfigMap.
* **Cloud-Native Exploration:** Research different Kubernetes networking models (e.g., Calico, Flannel, Weave Net). Compare their features and suitability for different use cases.
* **Conceptual Question:** What are the best practices for managing secrets in Kubernetes?


**Day 4:**

* **Documentation:**  Study Kubernetes Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims. Understand how they provide persistent storage for stateful applications.
* **Hands-on:** Create a PersistentVolumeClaim and use it to persist data within your Nginx pods (e.g., store logs or static content).
* **Cloud-Native Exploration:** Explore the concept of operator patterns in Kubernetes and how they streamline application deployment and management.
* **Conceptual Question:** What are the differences between a DaemonSet, Deployment, and StatefulSet in Kubernetes?


**Day 5:**

* **Documentation:**  Explore the Kubernetes documentation on Namespaces and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).  Understand their importance for security and isolation.
* **Hands-on:** Create a new Kubernetes namespace and deploy a separate Nginx Deployment into that namespace. Experiment with creating a Role and RoleBinding to restrict access to this new namespace.
* **Cloud-Native Exploration:** Research Kubernetes security best practices, including pod security policies (or their modern equivalents like Pod Security Admission) and network policies.
* **Conceptual Question:** How can you effectively monitor and troubleshoot issues in a Kubernetes cluster?


This is just a starting point.  Continue this daily routine, progressing through more advanced Kubernetes features (like Helm, Jobs, CronJobs) and then branching out to other DevOps tools and cloud-native concepts as you build your expertise. Remember to adapt this plan to your current skill level and learning goals.
