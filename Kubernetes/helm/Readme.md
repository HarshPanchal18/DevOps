# Helm

Helm — the package manager that has revolutionized how we deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes.

The Pain Points Helm Addresses

1. YAML Proliferation: Without Helm, you’re managing hundreds of static YAML files
2. Configuration Management: Handling different configurations across dev, staging, and production
3. Version Control: Tracking changes and enabling rollbacks
4. Reusability: Sharing and reusing deployment patterns across teams
5. Complexity: Simplifying complex multi-service deployments

## Key Components

1. Helm Client
    The Helm client is your command-line interface to the Helm ecosystem. It handles:

    - Chart development and management
    - Repository interactions
    - Release lifecycle management
    - Template rendering and validation

2. Charts
    Charts are Helm’s packaging format — think of them as blueprints for your applications. A chart contains:

    - Kubernetes resource templates
    - Default configuration values
    - Dependencies and requirements
    - Documentation and metadata

    - Example of the Helm chart of prometheus stack:

    ```markdown
    ├── Chart.lock
    ├── charts
    │   ├── crds/
    │   ├── grafana/
    │   ├── kube-state-metrics/
    │   ├── prometheus-node-exporter/
    │   └── prometheus-windows-exporter/
    ├── Chart.yaml
    ├── README.md
    ├── templates
    │   ├── alertmanager/
    │   ├── exporters/
    │   ├── extra-objects.yaml
    │   ├── grafana/
    │   ├── _helpers.tpl
    │   ├── NOTES.txt
    │   ├── prometheus/
    │   ├── prometheus-operator/
    │   └── thanos-ruler/
    └── values.yaml

    ```

3. Repositories
    Chart repositories are HTTP servers that host packaged charts. They provide:

    - Version management
    - Distribution mechanism
    - Discovery and search capabilities
    - Access control and authentication

4. Releases
    A release represents a specific deployment of a chart with particular configuration values. Releases enable:

    - Version tracking
    - Rollback capabilities
    - State management
    - Lifecycle hooks

## The Helm Workflow

The typical Helm workflow follows these stages:

1. Chart Creation: Develop templates and values
2. Validation: Lint and test charts
3. Packaging: Bundle charts for distribution
4. Installation: Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
5. Management: Upgrade, rollback, or uninstall

## Installation

### macOS

```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install helm

# Using installer script
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3>
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

### Linux

```bash
# Using snap
sudo snap install helm --classic

# Using installer script
curl <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3> | bash

# Using package managers
# Debian/Ubuntu
curl <https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc> | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install helm
```

### Windows

```bash
# Using Chocolatey
choco install kubernetes-helm

# Using Scoop
scoop install helm

# Using winget
winget install Helm.Helm
```

#### Downloading Helm via PowerShell

To download Helm directly using PowerShell, execute the following command:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.6.3-windows-amd64.zip" -OutFile "C:\path\to\your\folder\helm.zip"
```

In this command:

- `Invoke-WebRequest` is used to send an HTTP request to download files.
- `-Uri` specifies the URL from where to download Helm.
- `-OutFile` indicates the local path where the ZIP file will be saved.

#### Extracting the Helm Binary

Once the Helm ZIP file has been downloaded, the next step is to extract its contents. Use the following command:

```powershell
Expand-Archive -Path "C:\path\to\your\folder\helm.zip" -DestinationPath "C:\path\to\your\folder"
```

Ensure that the extraction was successful. Navigate to the destination folder to confirm that `helm.exe` is present.

#### Moving Helm to a Local Directory

To keep your system organized, it's advisable to move `helm.exe` to a more suitable directory, such as `C:\Program Files\Helm`.

```powershell
Move-Item -Path "C:\path\to\your\folder\windows-amd64\helm.exe" -Destination "C:\Program Files\Helm"
```

#### Adding Helm to your PATH

To modify the PATH environment variable using PowerShell, run this command:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\Program Files\Helm", [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
```

This command appends the Helm directory to the system's PATH variable. After updating your PATH, confirm the changes using:

```powershell
$env:Path -split ';'
```

#### Verifying the PATH Variable

Check if Helm is correctly added by typing `helm` in any PowerShell window.

```powershell
helm version
```

#### Setting Up Helm Repositories

Before starting to use Helm, it’s recommended to set up your chart repositories. This step ensures that you have access to various packages available for deployment in Kubernetes.

```bash
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
```

This command allows Helm to access ongoing updates and charts from the official repository.

### Verification and Initial Setup

After installation, verify Helm is working correctly:

```bash
# Check Helm version
helm version

# Add the official stable repository
helm repo add stable <https://charts.helm.sh/stable>

# Update repository information
helm repo update

# List available repositories
helm repo list
```
